## Analyzing Used Car Sales

### Project Summary
Here I aim to get at an overview of the automotive auction industry mainly with the objective to figure out where and which model of Ford F150 can be procured at the most affordable price.

**Note:**
Ford F-150 is the highest selling automobile for decades in the US.

### Objectives:
1. Read in and manipulate data with Pandas.
2. Build summary charts with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
3. Leverage Seaborn's advanced chart types to mine insights from the data and make a decision.

### The Data Set:
The data set consists of used car auction data (United States and Canada).
